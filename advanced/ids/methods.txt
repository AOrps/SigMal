There are many different methodologies used by IDPS to detect changes on the systems they
monitor. These changes can be external attacks or misuse by internal personnel. All the
methodologies use the same general model and the differences among them is mainly on how they
process information they gather from the monitored to determine if a violation of the set policy
has occurred.

It was pretty difficult to find anything with Immune System. Seems like the current trend in
security research pertaining to networks is AI/DL/ML.



1. Anomaly Based Methodology
* Anomaly based methodology works by comparing observed activity against a baseline profile.
    The baseline profile is the learned normal behaviour of the monitored system and is
    developed during the learning period were the IDPS learns the environment and develops a normal
    profile of a normal profile of the monitored system.

* The technique produces the most false positives and false negatives due to the high overhead
    on the system.

* The machine learning technique works by analyzing the system call and it is the widely used
    technique.

* Has the chance to detect new attacks.
--> Can do machine learning and using BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network)


2. Signature Based Methodology
* Signature based methodology works by comparing observed signatures to the signatures on file.
    This file can be a database or a list of known attack signatures. (Perhaps even a local repo)
    Any signatures on file is flagged as a violation of the security policy or as an attack.
    ( Can be optimized from a software POV using a set as opposed to using a list/array)

* Can not detect new attacks. (However, we may be able to get variants of the malicious entity,
    by using Fuzzy Hashing)

* It's simpler to modify and improve since its performance is mainly based on the signature or
    rules.

3. Stateful Protocol Analysis Based Methodology
* The Stateful protocol analysis methodology works by comparing established profiles
    how protocols should behave against the observed behaviour.

* Unlike the signature based methodology which only compares observed behaviour against a list,
    Stateful protocol analysis has a deep understanding of how the protocols and applications
    interact/work.

* The majority of the research on IDPS methodologies mainly concentrates on anamoly, signature,
    and hybrid methodologies which further reduce the viability of Stateful protocol analysis as
    a standalone IDPS.

* This architecture is identical to that of the signaure based methodology with one exception,
    instead of the signature database, it has a database of acceptable protocol behaviour.

4. Hybrid Based Methodology
* The hybrid based methodology works by combining two or more of the other methodologies.

* The result is a better methodology that takes advantage of the strengths of the combined
    methodologies.

*  A hybrid intrusion detection system of cluster-based wireless sensors networks was
    proposed that worked by breaking the detection into two, first it used anomaly based model
    to filter the data and then it used signature based model to detect intrusion attempts.

* Another model for a hybrid methodology was proposed based on how the human immune system
    works [22]. The proposed system is “based on the framework of the human immune system,
    that uses a hybrid architecture which applies both anomaly and misuse detection approaches”

* Essentially
    Monitored Environment -> Stateful Protocol Analysis -> Signature -> Anomaly -> Sanitized
    Environment



+ The thing about using Deep Learning or any {Buzzword/Devirative} Learning, is that they can be
    vulnerable to adversal attacks. Adversial attacks have shown that deep learning models are not
    reliable in the presence of malicious entiites.

* Neural network provides elasticity in intrusion detection process, where the neural network
    has the ability to analyze and ensure that data right or partially right. Likewise, neural
    network is capable of performing analysis on data in nonlinear fashion. 

* Neural network has the ability to process data from a number of sources in a non-linear
    fashion. This is very important especially when coordinated attack by multiple attackers
    is conducted against the network.

* Neural network is characterized by high speed in processing data [17].
