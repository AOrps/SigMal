![Sigâ€¢Mal Week 3](img/sem3-beetle.jpg)

## What are we doing this week?
* **Signatures / Magic Numbers / Hashing**

## Why?
* ~~To flex~~ For doing some really basic static analysis
z* Determining file types will help you identify teh malware's target OS and architecture 

## Good Commands to know and Use
- `hexdump`
- `xxd`
- `openssl`
    - `shasum`
    - `md5sum`
    - `md5`
- `ssdeep`
- `strings`

## Signatures
### What is a Signature?
* **File Signature** : data used to identify or verify the content of a file
* **Digital Signature** : mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, and that the messages was not altered in transit.

* CIA ancynoym for Cybersecurity:
    * C --> Confidentality
    * **I --> Integrity**
    * A --> Accessibilty


## Magic Numbers
### What are Magic numbers?
* ~~Magical Numbers that grant wishes~~ Just ways to represent a file at the byte level. -> **Metadata** -> (Basically also the same as File Signtures)
* File Signatures =  Magic Numbers = Magic Bytes
* Check out some [file signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)

### General Location of stuff (in a PE Executable)

## Hashing
### Dare I say it, What is Hashing?
* **Hashing** : is an an algorithm that calculates a fixed-size bit string value from a file . A file basically contains blocks of data. Hashing transforms this data into a far shorter fixed-length value or key which represents the original string. The hash value can be considered the distilled summary of everything within that file.

* **Context triggered piecewish hashes (fuzzy hashes)** : Really best way to describe it is as a fuzzy hash, it fuzzes the value when it computers the hash. (Provides invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to the program)

### Used to:
* **Hashing** : Check integrity of a file 
* **Fuzzy hash** : Check for files of similar data
* **Fingerprinting the Malware** : Generating the cryptographic hash values for the suspect binary based on file content.

### Types of Hashes
* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-256

> `shasum -a 256 (file)`


## ~~I want to flex harder~~ I am interested in learning more
### Some topics to look under
* **Classifying Malware Using yara**
    * Malware Researchers can create YARA rules based on textual or binary info contained withn the malware specimen
* **Section Hashing**
    * Hash by Section
* **Import Hashing**
    * Technique in which hash values are calculated based on library/imported function (API) names and their particular order within the executable.
        * if the filees were compiled from the same source and in the same manner, these files would tend to have the same imphash value (import hash)
