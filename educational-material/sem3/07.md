## Shellcode?
* What is it?
    * Actual Fun

* A **shellcode** is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.

* Often written in machine code and for opening a remote shell. 

* _Code that opens a shell_
---
## What does it look like?
```
// C Source
char code[] = \
"\x48\x31\xc9\x48\xf7\xe1\x04\x3b\x48\xbb"
"\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x52\x53"
"\x54\x5f\x52\x57\x54\x5e\x0f\x05";
```
* These are just hexadecimal values that represent the machine code of the 'malicious' assembly instructions.

* Note that the shellcode bytes are architecture-specific machine instructions. 
---
## Confessions / Reassurance
* When I was looking at Shellstorm for the First Time as a freshmen. I thought that they had obfuscated the malicious code so someone inexperienced, like me, would not be able to replicate it. 

* Then I got wiser (and took an assembly class and went sicko mode) and then realized the beautiful complexity of it.

* So don't worry. The stuff that we are talking about is not really for the meek and kinda advanced when you begin to replicate it and actually understand it in and out.
