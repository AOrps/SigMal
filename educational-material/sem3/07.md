## Shellcode?
* What is it?
    * Actual Fun

* A **shellcode** is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.
    * Injects into a running program.

* _Normally used to open a remote shell_
---
## What does it look like?
```C
// C Source
char code[] = \
"\x48\x31\xc9\x48\xf7\xe1\x04\x3b\x48\xbb"
"\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x52\x53"
"\x54\x5f\x52\x57\x54\x5e\x0f\x05";
```
* These are just hexadecimal values that represent the machine code of the 'malicious' assembly instructions.
* Note that the shellcode bytes are architecture-specific machine instructions.

## Confessions / Reassurance
* When I was looking at Shellstorm for the First Time as a freshmen. I thought that they had obfuscated the malicious code so someone inexperienced, like me, would not be able to replicate it. 

* Then I got wiser (and took an assembly class and went sicko mode) and then realized the beautiful complexity of it.

* So don't worry. The stuff that we are talking about is not really for the meek and kinda advanced when you begin to replicate it and actually understand it in and out.

## Before Shellcode Fun

* Architecture
* Sections

---
## Architecture
* x86 
    * Does 32-bit Architecture
    * Use `e` prefix in Assembly

* x86-64 (x64)
    * Does 64-bit Architecture
    * Use `r` prefix in Assembly

---
## Sections
* **Section** -> comprise all information needed for linking a target object file in order to build a working executable. 

* Common Sections
    * .text
    * .data
    * .bss
    * etc. (There are so many others.) 

---
## Shellcode Explained
* In order for shellcode to be shellcode, it must be **self-contained** and **linked**.

* **Self-contained** -> ready to take over control of the processor regardless of its current state. (Only code or .text section / segment)

* **Linked** -> Position-independent and able to be injected anywhere in memory.

## Shellcode Quirks 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AOrps/SigMal/master/educational-material/sem3/img/sectionInDisk.png)

* Shellcode isn't really an executable because it is not written into memory.

* Shellcode could be written anywhere in memory, so the instructions have to be calculated relative to Instruction Pointer via Stack.
---
## How to Shellcode PWN?
* Indubitably

---
## Building your own Shellcode 
1. Learn Assembly
    - Shellcode is normally written in Assembly Language and is actually architecture-specific machine
    - Assembly is not portable, but it does exactly what you need it to do!
    * Check DEMO
1. Figure out Target (Architecture, and General Recon)
1. **PWN READY**

---
## Deploying Shellcode
1. Stick it to an existing process or a running Program
1. **PWN-ed**

---
## Conclusion

* Naturally there are finer details to running this and getting your own home baked Shellcode
* It was only meant to be a holistic view of the process, not all. 
* If this interest you, do your own research into the topic!

## Security Discussion 
* Anyone have any experience in the field of security
    * Work Experience, Interviews, Projects, Companies, Barriers, etc
    * Really anything but in the scope of Cyber Security or Security in general
