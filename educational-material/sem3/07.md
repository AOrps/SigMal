## How are we doing folks?

---
## Shellcode?
* What is it?
    * Actual Fun

* A **shellcode** is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.
    * Injects into a running program.

---
## What does it look like?
```C
// C Source
char code[] = \
"\x48\x31\xc9\x48\xf7\xe1\x04\x3b\x48\xbb"
"\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x52\x53"
"\x54\x5f\x52\x57\x54\x5e\x0f\x05";
```
* These are just hexadecimal values that represent the machine code of the 'malicious' assembly instructions.
* Note that the shellcode bytes are architecture-specific machine instructions.

## Confessions / Reassurance
* When I was looking at Shellstorm for the First Time as a freshmen. I thought that they had obfuscated the malicious code so someone inexperienced, like me, would not be able to replicate it. 

* Then I got wiser (and took an assembly class and went sicko mode) and then realized the beautiful complexity of it.

* So don't worry. The stuff that we are talking about is not really for the meek and kinda advanced when you begin to replicate it and actually understand it in and out.

## Sections and inner working of Executables
* **Section** -> comprise all information needed for linking a target object file in order to build a working executable. 

* Common Sections
    * .text
    * .data
    * .bss
    * There are so many others. 

---
## Shellcode Explained
* In order for shellcode to be shellcode, it must be **self-contained** and **linked**.

* **Self-contained** -> ready to take over control of the processor regardless of its current state. (Only code or .text section / segment)

* **Linked** ->

## Shellcode Quirks

* Shellcode isn't really an executable because it is not written into memory.

## Security Discussion 
* Anyone have any experience in the field of security
    * Work Experience, Interviews, Projects, Companies, Barriers, etc
    * Really anything but in the scope of Cyber Security or Security in general
