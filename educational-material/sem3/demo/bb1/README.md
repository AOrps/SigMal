# Baffling Buffer 1

The following is a walk-through of a problem taken from [MetaCTF](https://metactf.com/) CyberGames 2020. I have no idea how long their server will keep hosting this problem. No copyright infringement is intended.

## Problem

After pointing out the initial issue, the developers issued a new update on the login service and restarted it at `host1.metaproblems.com 5151`. Looking at the [binary](bb1) and [source code](bb1.c), you discovered that this code is still vulnerable.

## Solution

TBD
