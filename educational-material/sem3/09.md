# Week 9 - Buffer Overflows

**Author:** [peppermintpatty5](https://github.com/peppermintpatty5)

Try out the code samples yourself where you see :keyboard: !

## C Arrays

* C is a statically typed language
    * The type of every variable is known at compile time
* Array declaration syntax

    ```c
    int my_array[10]; /* array of 10 integers */
    ```

* Strange things can happen when you access outside the bounds of the array
    * Usually, the program crashes
    * Buffer overflow vulnerabilities

## The `gets` function

From the ISO C99 specification

### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>
char *gets(char *s);
```

### Description

The `gets` function reads characters from the input stream pointed to by `stdin`, into the array pointed to by `s`, until end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read. Any new-line character is discarded, and a null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.

## :keyboard: The Dangers of `gets`

* The user can crash the program by entering a sufficiently long string

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
    {
        char s[10];

        gets(s);
        printf("User entered '%s'\n", s);

        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```

* Use `fgets` instead

    ```c
    fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);
    ```

## The Stack

* All function variables have automatic storage duration by default
    * The C keyword `auto` is seldom used

        ```c
        void foo(void)
        {
            auto int i; /* automatic storage duration */
            static int j; /* static storage duration */
        }
        ```

* `auto` variables are stored on the stack
    * Sometimes variables are stored in registers for efficiency
* `%rsp` is the register containing the stack pointer
    * The stack is "upside-down"
    * Grow/shrink the stack by decreasing/increasing `%rsp` respectively

## :keyboard: Buffers in Assembly

Example `buf.c`:

```c
extern void func_1(void);
extern void func_2(int *);

void func_1(void)
{
    int buf[50];

    func_2(buf); /* use buf, avoid getting optimized out */
}
```

Compile `buf.c` **without stack protector**, optimized for debugging. Disassemble the resulting object file `buf.o`.

```sh
gcc -c -Og --no-stack-protector buf.c
objdump -d buf.o
```

Sample output:

```txt

buf.o:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000000000 <func_1>:
   0:   f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
   4:   48 81 ec d8 00 00 00    sub    $0xd8,%rsp
   b:   48 89 e7                mov    %rsp,%rdi
   e:   e8 00 00 00 00          callq  13 <func_1+0x13>
  13:   48 81 c4 d8 00 00 00    add    $0xd8,%rsp
  1a:   c3                      retq
```
