# Last min Learning
---
A **disassembler** is a way to statically analyze executables (or files). Meaning that the program does not actually run, rather one just sees what it looks like. 

A **debugger** is a way to dynamically analyze executables (or files). Meaning that the debugger actually runs the files and sees what it does. 

A somewhat decent analogy to describe what I mean, would be like the difference between cat pogchamp.py vs  python3 pogchamp.py

# Discussion and Stuff
---
## What we had planned for the last meeting?
* We were gonna get an ACM drone and run a deauth attack.
* Maybe finish that keylogger from last semester (maybe lol)

* But due to slowing down / complete halt of some things. We were not able to get the intended supplies.
