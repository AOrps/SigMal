# Last min Learning
---
A **disassembler** is a way to statically analyze executables (or files). Meaning that the program does not actually run, rather one just sees what it looks like. 

A **debugger** is a way to dynamically analyze executables (or files). Meaning that the debugger actually runs the files and sees what it does. 

A somewhat decent analogy to describe what I mean, would be like the difference between cat pogchamp.py vs  python3 pogchamp.py
