## Steganography


**What is Stegonagraphy?** 
In essence, Steg is hiding things inside images. This can vary from text, files, or even running code.

Exhibit A: The untouched image
==================================

This is the unaltered image. I made a copy of it called purewillick, this is mainly for the next step.

Exhibit B: Hiding a message in the image, and comparing the pure images and the edited images.
==================================

Notice when comparing the hex from the pure image and the altered image. Of course, when we use something like xxd, it will display something like this.
