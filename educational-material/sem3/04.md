## Bypassing Signature based IDS/IDPS
---

## What is an IDS / IDPS?
* **IDS** : Intrusion Detection Systems 
    * is the process of monitoring the events occurring in your network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, violations, or imminent threats to your security policies.
* **IDPS** : Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
    * is the process of performing intrusion detection and then stopping the detected incidents. (Sometimes called IPS)

---

## Types of IDS / IDPS

* Anomaly Based Methodology
* Signature Based Methodology
* Stateful Protocol Analysis Based Methodology
* Hybrid Based Methodology

---
### How do they work?

---

### Anomaly Based Methodology
* Anomaly based methodology works by comparing observed activity against a baseline profile. The baseline profile is the learned normal behaviour of the monitored system and is developed during the learning period were the IDPS learns the environment and develops a normal profile of a normal profile of the monitored system.

* The technique produces the most false positives and false negatives due to the high overhead on the system.

* Machine Learning can be implemented and there is a common ML (Machine Learning) technique that works by analyzing the system call

* Has the chance to detect new attacks.

---

### Signature Based Methodology
* Signature based methodology works by comparing observed signatures to the signatures on file.
* This file can be a database or a list of known attack signatures. 
* Any signatures on file is flagged as a violation of the security policy or as an attack.
* Can not detect new attacks. <!-- (However, we may be able to get variants of the malicious entity, by using Fuzzy Hashing) --> 
* It's simpler to modify and improve since its performance is mainly based on the signature or rules.

* **Blacklist**

---

### Stateful Protocol Analysis Based Methodology
* The Stateful protocol analysis methodology works by comparing established profiles how protocols should behave against the observed behaviour.

* Unlike the signature based methodology which only compares observed behaviour against a list, Stateful protocol analysis has a deep understanding of how the protocols and applications interact/work.

* The majority of the research on IDPS methodologies mainly concentrates on anamoly, signature, and hybrid methodologies which further reduce the viability of Stateful protocol analysis as a standalone IDPS.

* This architecture is identical to that of the signaure based methodology with one exception, instead of the signature database, it has a database of acceptable protocol behaviour. 

* **Whitelist**

---

### Hybrid Based Methodology
* The hybrid based methodology works by combining two or more of the other methodologies.

* The result is a better methodology that takes advantage of the strengths of the combined methodologies.

* Another model for a hybrid methodology was proposed based on how the human immune system works, which applies both anomaly and misuse detection approaches”

* Often seen being:  `Monitored Environment -> Stateful Protocol Analysis -> Signature -> Anomaly -> Sanitized Environment`

---
### Extra Notes
+ The thing about using Deep Learning or any {Buzzword Devirative} Learning, is that they can be vulnerable to adversal attacks. Adversial attacks have shown that deep learning models are not reliable in the presence of malicious entiites.

* Neural network provides elasticity in intrusion detection process, where the neural network has the ability to analyze and ensure that data right or partially right. Likewise, neural network is capable of performing analysis on data in nonlinear fashion. 

* Neural network has the ability to process data from a number of sources in a non-linear fashion. This is very important especially when coordinated attack by multiple attackers is conducted against the network.

* Neural network is characterized by high speed in processing data.

## Bypassing Signature-based IDS / IDPS

* **LITERALLY JUST CHANGE THE SIGNATURE**

### Methods

* **Obfuscation**
* Encoding ~ (IT430 Method)
* Encryption
* Writing junk code

Generally an attacker will `'Fingerprint' the brand of IDS or IPS` and exploit flaws in that particular code, figure .

---

### Obfuscation
* Malware obfuscation makes data unreadable.
* Most malware has obfuscated strings that hide the instructions that tell the infected machine what do do and when to do it.
* Obfuscation conceals the malware data so that static code analyzers simply skip over it.

| Simple Malware Obfuscation Techniques| Advanced Malware Obfuscation Techniques
| :-- | :---
| XOR, Base64, ROT13 and codepacking, interposed text |  Environmental awareness, obfuscating internal data

* Codepacking: sometimes called _"self-extracting archives"_, the actual malware is compressed and when ran the malware is decompressed and that then executed.
* Interposed text: Text inserted between itself or other things

* Can also use things like [Protectors](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/malware/2017/03/explained-packer-crypter-and-protector/)

--- 

### Encoding 
* Common misperception that Metasploit's encoders were designed to help bypass antivirus program
    * -> Some of Metasploit's encoders create polymorphic code, or mutating code which ensures that the encoded payloads looks different.
* Base64 is often used to encode malware, it was meant to standardize code. However, malicious programmers take advnatage of this by injecting false character strings.


---

### Encryption
* Malware Encryption is the process of encoding information so only authorized parties can access the data in a readable format. 
* Malware that is encrypted is/are called crypter(s). However malware that uses encryption with a malicious intent is called ransomware. 
* Used to : `prevent disassembly -> prevents reverse engineeering`
    * Helpful to understand the common crypto algorithms used to create symmterically encrypted code. 

---

### Writing Junk Code
* Adding useless code can potentially change the signature of the program (by adding more content)
* Can be used to slow down a reverse engineer by giving them copious amounts of data / functions to look through
