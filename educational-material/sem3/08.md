## Interesting Python Thing

### Buffer?
```python
>>> eval("1+1")
2
>>> str(_)
'2'
```
### Python single-line 
```bash
python3 -c 'import time; func = lambda x: print(f"{x}") or time.sleep(1); [func(f"potato-{i + 1}") for i in range(100)]'
```
* Just a cool script I wrote that I think is kinda based

## NOP SLED
* NOP Slide / NOP Sled / NOP Ramp
* NOP (No operation) instructions meant to slide the CPU's instruction execution flow to its final desired location. 
* Useful in evading Stack Randomization

> Stack randomization and other runtime differences may make the address where the program will jump impossible to predict, so the attacker places a NOP sled in a big range of memory. If the program jumps to anywhere into the sled, it will run all the remaining NOPs, doing nothing, and then will run the payload code, just next to the sled. ~ [How does a NOP Sled work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14760587/how-does-a-nop-sled-work)

## Intro to Countermeasures
* There is a co-evolution between hackers and cyber security operators / security engineers.
* Overall this process is beneficial (better to have smaller scale attacks as opposed to full fledged cyber attacks that do some severe damage)
* This process requires both parties to become more technologically saavy to get a step up in the all out war.

## Countermeasures
* System Daemons
* Tools of the Trade
* Log Files

***DO the Demo in Linux***

---
## System Daemons
* In linux, *system daemons* tirelessly perform tasks like providing SSH service and keeping system logs.
* Daemon programs typically end with a `d` to denote they are daemons, *sshd* or *syslogd*
* They normally run detached from a terminal and it writes to a log file as opposed to stdout. 
    * Without a controlling terminal, they are then typically controlled via signals.
        * In order for the system daemon to exit cleanly it will need a terminate signal.

* Let's see how signals and system daemons work! **(DEMO TIME)**

---
## Why are daemons important for us?
* We need a realistic exploitation target, if we really want to exploit countermeasures and bypass methods. 
* A remote target will be a server program that accepts incoming connections, which in *nix are usually system daemons.


---
## Tools of the Trade
* Let's look at at system daemons from an attacker's side and let's do some scripting!
    * Scripting makes you seem like an actual l33t hacker, especially when you are able to write programs on the fly. 
        * May not be optimized for scalability and performance.

* Let's write a script to exploit a program! **(DEMO TIME)**

## à¶ž ((Hello World)(S)US)
* Let's analyze executables in different ways while keeping "the same output"
    * Hello World Program in a bunch of different languages. 

(DEMO TIME / Results )
