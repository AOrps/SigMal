## Building

* Git and GitHub are best suited for tracking plaintext files. Therefore, we are experimenting with a workflow that generates PowerPoints from Markdown using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). To build all files, simply run [`build.sh`](build.sh).

* Another experimental process is [mdToThing](https://github.com/njitacm/mdToThing) which uses [marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) for generating `{ .pptx | .pdf | .html }` files from `{ .md }` and will also have a custom CSS template.

## How to Contribute

* `<TEMPORARY THIS SHOULD EVENTUALLY BE DELETED>`

1. `cp template.md foo.md`
2. Push changes
3. Optional: Run mdToThing scripts on `foo.md` file to test compatibility
