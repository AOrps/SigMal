## Today
* We are gonna talk about Assembly!
    * Initially, I was gonna do diassembly, but that's a good lesson to fall asleep to. 
* We can do a little primer into gdb and 'proper' debugging.

---
## What is Assembly
* Fun
* So so much Fun
* "Low-level" meant to be a one-to-one map of the machine instructions.
    * Machine instructions are just hexdecimal values (also called _**opcodes**_) that tell the computer what to do.
* We are gonna talk about how you can use assembly and debugging to find bugs and (maybe also help solve challenges)

## Hello World in C/C++ + Python3

### C / C++
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

### Python3
* `python3 -c 'print(f"Hello, World!")'`
* `print("Hello, World!")`

---
## Hello World in Assembly
```
; assemble with "nasm -f bin -o hi.com hello-DOS.asm"

mov  dx, msg
mov  ah, 9  
int  0x21

mov  ah, 0x4c
int  0x21

msg  db 'Hello, World!', 0x0d, 0x0a, '$'
```
* Taken from [Low-level Assembly](https://montcs.bloomu.edu/Information/LowLevel/Assembly/hello-asm.html)
* This is 16-bit Assembly (a very very ancient form)
---
## Assembly Quirks
* Apparently Assembly is so verbose, that you can make a turing complete language from just one instruction.
    * **MOV**

### Fun Experiment 
* Check [movcc](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)
* Some absolute chads went sicko mode and now you can compile your code in only mov instructions 

---
## Debugging
```
lst = ["hello", "wtf", "bruh", "poggers", "pog", "full send"] # The most common words I say
utlimate_word_from_list = ""

for val in range(len(lst)):
    print(val)

```


---
## Why learn this?
* ~~Lol to **flex**~~
* Interested in the big brain Reverse Engineering?
    * To understand we must do more than just read it.
        * _Also sometimes these programs are not on Github_

## GDB - GNU Debugger
* The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on "inside" another program while is executes.

* GDB can do 4 main kinds of things to help you catch bugs in the act:
    * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
    * Make your program stop on specified conditions.
    * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
    * Chanhge things in your program, so you can experiment with coorecting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

<!-- This was taken straight from the gdb manual -->
---
## Basic Commands in GDB
* `r` -> Run
* `q` -> Quit

## Wanna get slightly more sophicasted with Debugging
