## Today
* We are gonna talk about Assembly!
    * Initially, I was gonna do diassembly, but that's a good lesson to fall asleep to. 
* We can do a little primer into gdb and 'proper' debugging.

---
## What is Assembly
* Fun
* So so much Fun
* **Not portable**
* "Low-level" meant to be a one-to-one map of the machine instructions.
    * Machine instructions are just hexdecimal values (also called _**opcodes**_) that tell the computer what to do.
        * Machine instructions are meant to be 'self-explanatory' but `FCOM` is not immediately known to me
        <!-- FCOM is Float Comparison -->
* We are gonna talk about how you can use assembly and debugging to find bugs and (maybe also help solve challenges)

## Hello World in C/C++ + Python3

### C / C++
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

### Python3
* `python3 -c 'print(f"Hello, World!")'`
* `print("Hello, World!")`

---
## Hello World in Assembly
```as
mov  dx, msg
mov  ah, 9  
int  0x21

mov  ah, 0x4c
int  0x21

msg  db 'Hello, World!', 0x0d, 0x0a, '$'
```
* Taken from [Low-level Assembly](https://montcs.bloomu.edu/Information/LowLevel/Assembly/hello-asm.html)
* This is 16-bit Assembly (a very very ancient form)
---
## Basic Assembly 
* There are 4 general purpose registers
    * `ax` ->  Accumulator
    * `bx` -> Base
    * `cx` -> Counter
    * `dx` -> Data / Display

### Sike there is 4 more
* Here are another 4 general purpose registers
    * `sp` -> stack pointer
    * `bp` -> base pointer
    * `si` -> Source index
    * `ip` -> instruction pointer    <- This is the OG one 

---
## Remember when I said not Portable?
* `ax` is for 16 bit systems
* `eax` is for 32 bit systems
* `rax` is for 64 bit systems

* You have to write ASM / (.s) / assembly based on architectures, 
---
## Assembly Quirks
* Apparently Assembly is so verbose, that you can make a turing complete language from just one of it's instructions:
    * **MOV**

### Fun Experiment 
* Check [movcc](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)
* Some absolute chads went sicko mode and now you can compile your code in only mov instructions 

---
## Debugging
```python
lst = ["hello", "wtf", "bruh", "poggers", "pog", "full send"] # The most common words I say
utlimate_word_from_list = ""

for val in range(len(lst)):
    print(val)  # Your 'debug' line, what is val why do you get an error
    ultimate_word_from_list += val

print(utlimate_word_from_list)
```
* Normally when you think of debugging, this might be debugging for you.
    * What if I told you we can get more **swag**?

* There are people will argue for the sake of arguing and say that this is not debugging. 
    * But it is quick and dirty and it _(hopefully)_ gets the job / task done.

* But what about more complex tasks? 
    * Recursion, or Complex Objects

* What if you just want a deeper dive into the language for kicks?

---
## Why learn this?
* ~~Lol to **flex**~~
* Interested in the big brain Reverse Engineering?
    * To understand we must do more than just read it.
        * _Also sometimes these programs are not on Github_
        * Lol, maybe interacting with proprietary software :eyes:

* NB: Some proprietary software does not like when you try to reverse engineer or 'debug' them
    * DW tho, you just have to get more creative `;)` :wink:

## GDB - GNU Debugger
* The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on "inside" another program while is executes.

* GDB can do 4 main kinds of things to help you catch bugs in the act:
    * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
    * Make your program stop on specified conditions.
    * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
    * Chanhge things in your program, so you can experiment with coorecting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

<!-- This was taken straight from the gdb manual -->

---
## Basic Commands in GDB
* `r` -> **r**un
* `b <func name> || <addr>` -> **b**reak, Set a breakpoint at address
* `i r <register>` -> **i**nfo on **r**egister at `<register>`
* `q` -> **q**uit

---
## More fancy stuff

* Can also do `x/2x $eip` to get the default 2 'words' in output from and including that address in hex

* `x/xh` for 2 bytes in size output
* `x/xw` for 4 bytes in size output
* `x/xg` for 8 bytes in size output

---
## Wanna get slightly more sophicasted with Debugging
* Below are some debuggers

### Open Source
* [Cutter](https://cutter.re/)

### Paid
* [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/)
* [IDA PRO](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) <- Really expensive but industry standard

* There are undoubtedly more but most stuff comes from capstone, so you can always build your own.
    * Capstone is a framework for disassembly
