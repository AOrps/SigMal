# Signature Based IDS

## Goal 
* Improve from the signature-based IDS demo program _(or create a new one)_
* **Optional**: Try to have the same program and try to bypass the newly created IDS (More advanced)


## What is a signature based IDS?
* A signature-based IDS solution typically monitors inbound network traffic to find sequences and patterns that match a particular attack signature.

## Common IDS:
* [snort3](https://github.com/snort3/snort3)
